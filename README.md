# Tenzies-Game
Tenzies Game is a digital adaptation of the classic dice game. The goal is simple: roll the dice until all dice show the same number. Players can click on individual dice to hold their values between rolls, strategizing to achieve the goal in the fewest rolls and shortest time possible.
